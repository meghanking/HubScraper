So this worked at one point. I have no idea if it does now. I wanna learn how to manage my project using Sublime to learn the build structure a bit more. Mostly because I am just learning the difference between doing that versus an IDE, but will find a middeground eventually.

@andrewjkerr here it is, after a year of holding onto this for no reason.

Origin Story"

Throughout college. a good friend of mine was doing awesome linguistic research. One day, they told me about wanting to see if he could look at video meetadata and comments on pornhub videos. I thought I could try and see how I could do this using software as a tool. 

So I spent a few days during thanksgiving break working on this. So glad they always had a computer for us to play random games on (After Dark Games ftw) [If anyone knows of a way i can install After Dark games on Windows 10, let me know.] 

I have some amount of data, but didn't do anything with it. It's just sitting around. This will mostly be worked on if my friend still needs to information being scraped for.... Only time will tell!
